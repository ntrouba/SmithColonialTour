<body><center>The first place we are going to explore is the Quadrangle more informally called the Quad. 
  A good chunk of students attending Smith College live in one of the ten houses here. The space is 
  often occupied by students studying, eating, or just hanging out in between classes. The quad was 
  built in stages beginning in 1922, as additional housing for the growing student population. Among t
  he houses on the quad includes Wilder House, named after former professor Harris Hawthrone Wilder(1864-1928). 
  Wilder was a professor of zoology interested in genealogical study and this led to his excavation of indigenous 
  bodies around the Hadley region(Bruchac). Not only did Wilder excavate but local students did as well, even local newspapers 
  reported fondly of the expeditions. From these excavations a display was made for the museum which we will go more 
  in-depth at the Smith College Museum of Art. The naming of Wilder House after him stands as a colonial keepsake, 
  a stain that outlives many of the memories of the people who were excavated by Wilder.</center>

  <center>Looking at the Quad today it is hard not to find the area quite charming. Sitting on the grass on a warm fall day watching
   the colors change on the leaves with everyone else taking in the scenery as well. The area shows off much of the scenic nature 
   Smith College is known for. 
  Most students and faculty are unaware of the colonial history that lies around campus and this tour just hopes to highlight some 
  of it in order to be conscious of the past existence of the land.</center>
