<body><center>Our last stop on the tour today is Northampton's public library, Forbes Library. Gifted to the town in 1894 
  by Judge Charles Edward Forbes, Forbes has been a part of the community for over 125 years. In fact, Forbes assisted 
  Sophia Smith in writing her will which established Smith College in 1848(Harrison, 72). 
  Up until the establishment of Neilson Library, Forbes served as the main library for Smith students. Forbes 
  hosts an abundance of information in its building spanning books, media, and collections among much more. One of 
  the things still stored at Forbes to this day is Sally Maminash's Bible, an indigenous woman declared the last of the Indians 
  there(Historic Northampton). It is not until recently that Forbes has spoken up about any indigenous history.</center>

<br>
<br>
<p>Here is the acknowledgement on their website:</p>
<br>
<blockquote><p.italic><center>"Forbes Library stands on Nonotuck land. 
  We also acknowledge our neighboring Indigenous nations: the Nipmuc and the Wampanoag to the East, 
  the Mohegan and Pequot to the South, the Mohican to the West, and the Abenaki to the North. 
  We pay our respects to indigenous Elders, past and present, of these communities and any others who may be here today. 
  This is and always will be indigenous land."</center></p.italic></blockquote>
  <br>
  <body><center>The statement sits on their website but offers virtually nothing else as these words do not give insight into how 
    Forbes recognizes their colonial legacy. However, Forbes has made efforts in the past few years to hold events and fundraising 
    pertaining to BIPOC art(Forbes Library). </center>
  </body>
  <br>
  <body><center>As someone who works at the Forbes Library I see the positive impact the library has on the community. The resources the 
    library provides the community such as internet, information, and career counseling among other things are vital for many people 
    and Forbes works to improve itself and the livelihood of its patrons. The staff that works there today all care deeply about helping 
    everyone in the community with the resources we can provide.</center>
