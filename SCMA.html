<body><center> The Smith College Museum of Art is an art museum started by Smith in the 1870s. 
  Today you will see visitors passing through the museum throughout the day exploring 
  the art of students and even the likes of Andy Warhol and other well-known artists. It 
  is substantially sized for a small liberal arts college and always has displays drawing
   in students and visitors. The museum had humble beginnings but Smith believed in having 
   an academic museum as a part of the liberal arts mission. The SCMA did not start at the
    location it is in today but a much smaller building. These beginnings however involved
     some practices that we today can identify as colonial. A predecessor to the SCMA began
      a collection of Native American artifacts, many of which had been excavated from the 
      local area. One name that stands out in these pieces' cleaving is Harris Hawthorne Wilder.
       If the name sounds familiar it is most likely because Wilder house is named after him as
        we already learned from our exploration of the Quad. Wilder got permission from Harvard
         College to dig up North Hadley in search of Indigenous bones. He actively participated
          in and promoted the disinterment of graves, dissection of bodies, and claiming of native artifacts(GovInfo, 27927).
           These items were taken in a display of colonial power ignoring the epistemological histories,
            creating their axiological desire for the pieces. Somewhere aroun 1960 to Smith began to repatriate these
             human remains but to this day has yet to finish as many items still sit at UMass Amherst. Currently, there is an exhibition,
              "Colonial Entanglements: Native American Artwork from the SCMA Collection" discussing the SCMA's
               past with Native American artwork. Many of the pieces in this collection feature "Artist once known"
                as the erasure of Native American authorship was prevalent when these artifacts were obtained(SCMA). </center>
